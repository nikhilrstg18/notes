Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the tag `<p>` which **creates a new paragraph**. We place all of our regular text inside the element `<p>`.

When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we can use to **control the text or make it appear in a certain way**.

## Key Elements
