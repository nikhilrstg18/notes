## `<textarea>` tag

- The `<textarea>` tag defines a multi-line text input control.

- The `<textarea>` element is often used in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews.

- A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).

- The size of a text area is specified by the cols and rows attributes (or with CSS).

- The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the text area will be submitted).

- The id attribute is needed to associate the text area with a label.

‚≠ê: Always add the `<label>` tag for best accessibility practices!
