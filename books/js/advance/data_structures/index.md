## What are Data Structures ?

Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. Each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.


## Operations On Data Structures

#### Insertion: 
Add a new data item in a given collection of items such as us adding the apple item in memory.

#### Deletion: 
Delete data such as remove mango from our list.

#### Traversal:
Traversal simply means accessing each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.

#### Searching:
We want to find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection.

#### Sorting:
Having data that is sorted.

#### Access:
How do we access this data that we have on our computer?
